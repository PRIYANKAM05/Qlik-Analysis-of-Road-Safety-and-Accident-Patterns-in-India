# Road Safety Analysis Using Qlik Analytics
## Project Description

This project leverages Qlik's data analytics platform to analyze road safety and accident patterns in India. By integrating data from traffic reports, accident records, weather conditions, road infrastructure, and demographic information, the project aims to identify trends, hotspots, and factors contributing to road accidents. The insights derived from this analysis will help stakeholders implement effective road safety measures to reduce accidents and save lives.
